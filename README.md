# 🚀 Optimal Control 🎓

Welcome to the Optimal Control  repository! This repository is dedicated to sharing the homework assignments and course materials for the Optimal Control course at K.N. Toosi University of Technology.

## Course Overview 📚

Optimal control is a crucial discipline in engineering and mathematics that focuses on optimizing dynamic systems to achieve desired performance while adhering to constraints. In this course, we will explore key topics such as optimal control theory, dynamic programming, Pontryagin's principle, and more, under the guidance of Professor Hamid Khaloozadeh from the Department of Systems and Control, K.N. Toosi University of Technology.
